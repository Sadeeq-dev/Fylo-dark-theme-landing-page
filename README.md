## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Use of flex inside of grid and more of responsive design

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    gap: 20px;
    margin-top: -70px;
}
```


### Continued development

more complex layouts and responsiveness
